# How to run my project! 

## Clone the project

   Execute: "git clone git@github.com:leandrosenazuza/ambev-challenge.git"

## First - Run the docker!

   Inside the project directory, you have to initiate the docker.

   After, you have to up your docker image. So run: "docker-compose up -d", insite this first directory "ambev-challenge"

## Second - Run the migrations!

   Inside the API directory, run: 
   1. dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration --context DefaultContext
   2. dotnet ef database update --context DefaultContext

## Third - Take the collections in the root of the project and put it in you postman

   1. To consume any request, you have to authenticate your api. Until you don't create any user, you have to use the standard user. Here's the curl to generate the token:
   curl --location 'https://localhost:7181/api/Auth' \
--header 'accept: text/plain' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "email": "admin@gmail.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}'

## Forth - Use the collection to test!
   1. Import the archieve - AMBEV-CHALLENGE.postman_collection

## Run the tests to ensure that everything is working


## What I think I achieved with this project:

1. Proficiency in C# and .NET 8.0 development ‚úÖ
2. Project Layer Separation ‚úÖ
3. Database skills with both PostgreSQL | MongoDB ‚úÖ | ‚ùå
4. Understanding and implementation of design patterns (e.g., Mediator pattern) ‚úÖ
5. Ability to work with object-relational mapping tools (EF Core) ‚úÖ 
6. Proficiency in writing and maintaining unit tests using xUnit ‚úÖ
7. Experience with mocking frameworks like NSubstitute ‚úÖ
8. Familiarity with object mapping libraries such as AutoMapper ‚úÖ
9. API design and RESTful service implementation ‚úÖ
10. Version control with Git  ‚úÖ
11. Understanding of both relational and non relational database systems ‚úÖ
12. Data generation and management for testing purposes (using Faker) ‚úÖ | ‚ùå
13. Code organization and project structure ‚úÖ
14. Implementation of pagination, filtering, and sorting in APIs‚úÖ
15. Error handling and API response formatting ‚úÖ
16. Use of Git Flow and Semantic Commits ‚úÖ
17. Performance optimization for database queries and API responses ‚úÖ
18. Understanding of asynchronous programming patterns ‚úÖ
19. Code quality and adherence to best practices ‚úÖ
20. Problem-solving and analytical skills ‚úÖ
21. Attention to detail in implementing business logic ‚úÖ | üöß Only the cart api is not implemented.
22. Ability to work with and integrate multiple technologies and frameworks ‚úÖ

## If I had more time:

1. I could create the messager send to a MQTT server each sale operation;
2. More tests;
3. The cart api.

# Developer Evaluation Project

`READ CAREFULLY`

## Instructions
**The test below will have up to 7 calendar days to be delivered from the date of receipt of this manual.**

- The code must be versioned in a public Github repository and a link must be sent for evaluation once completed
- Upload this template to your repository and start working from it
- Read the instructions carefully and make sure all requirements are being addressed
- The repository must provide instructions on how to configure, execute and test the project
- Documentation and overall organization will also be taken into consideration

## Use Case
**You are a developer on the DeveloperStore team. Now we need to implement the API prototypes.**

As we work with `DDD`, to reference entities from other domains, we use the `External Identities` pattern with denormalization of entity descriptions.

Therefore, you will write an API (complete CRUD) that handles sales records. The API needs to be able to inform:

* Sale number
* Date when the sale was made
* Customer
* Total sale amount
* Branch where the sale was made
* Products
* Quantities
* Unit prices
* Discounts
* Total amount for each item
* Cancelled/Not Cancelled

It's not mandatory, but it would be a differential to build code for publishing events of:
* SaleCreated
* SaleModified
* SaleCancelled
* ItemCancelled

If you write the code, **it's not required** to actually publish to any Message Broker. You can log a message in the application log or however you find most convenient.

### Business Rules

* Purchases above 4 identical items have a 10% discount
* Purchases between 10 and 20 identical items have a 20% discount
* It's not possible to sell above 20 identical items
* Purchases below 4 items cannot have a discount

These business rules define quantity-based discounting tiers and limitations:

1. Discount Tiers:
   - 4+ items: 10% discount
   - 10-20 items: 20% discount

2. Restrictions:
   - Maximum limit: 20 items per product
   - No discounts allowed for quantities below 4 items
